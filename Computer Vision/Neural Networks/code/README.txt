To run this python notebook you will need to do two things.

Step 1:
	First, you will need to have an image (jpg or png) and place it in the same directory	
	as the notebook.

Step 2:	
	Second, in the first cell of the notebook, there are two variable respectively "PATH" and "IMAGE_NAME".
	Modify "PATH" to be the directory where the notebook (and image) is located.
	Modify "IMAGE_NAME" to match the name of the image that was added to the notebook's directory from step 1.



All the imports used for this notebook are already pre-installed imports that work with the Google Collaboratory environment. 

It is important that when running this notebook, there should be no other files/directories in the working directory other than this notebook and the image that the YoloV3 model will be used to recognize objects on.
