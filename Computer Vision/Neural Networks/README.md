# ECSE 415 - Assignment 4: Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for **Assignment 4** of the course **Introduction to Computer Vision (ECSE 415)**. The assignment is divided into two parts: 
1. **CIFAR-10 Classification using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)**
2. **YOLO Object Detection on Montréal Streets**

## Submission
The solution is provided as a single Jupyter notebook. Ensure you follow the format outlined in the submission instructions.

## Contents
- **CIFAR-10 Classification**: Implementation of a CNN to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **YOLO Object Detection**: Detection of objects in a captured image of a street in Montréal using a pre-trained YOLOv3 model.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code:
- Pytorch
- torchvision
- Numpy
- OpenCV
- skimage
- YOLOv3 (pre-trained model)

### Library Versions
Please ensure that the following versions are installed:
- Pytorch: 1.7.0 or later
- torchvision: 0.8.1 or later
- Numpy: 1.19.2
- OpenCV: 4.4.0
- skimage: 0.17.2

## Running the Code
To run the code, follow these steps:
1. Select an Image and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter NoteBook
2. Modify the PATH variable at the top of the Jupyter NoteBook such that it points to the directory where the notebook (and the image from step 1) are located
3. Modify IMAGE_NAME to match the name of the image that was added to the notebook's directory (step 1)


All of the imports used for this notebook are already pre-installed imports that work with the GOogle Collaboratory environment.
