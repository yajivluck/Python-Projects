To run this notebook, modify the PATH variable to point to the directory where all the four images that are used in this notebook reside. These are the Person.png, street.png, landscape.png and the fourth picture is a picture we took from montreal from the previous assignment. I have called it Montreal_Picture.jpg. Make sure that the fourth image you are using has that same name. Everything else should run smoothly as I am pip installing most if not all the imports that you will need to run this solution smoothly as well as the specific versions of each libraries imported.
