# Machine Learning Mini-Project: Linear and Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project investigates the performance of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models on two distinct datasets: one related to building energy efficiency and the other focused on predicting company bankruptcies. The goal was to implement and evaluate these models using various techniques to understand their effectiveness and optimize their performance.

## Datasets
1. **Energy Efficiency Dataset**: Contains data on 768 buildings, including physical characteristics and their respective heating and cooling loads.
2. **Qualitative Bankruptcy Dataset**: Comprises data on 66 companies, featuring financial ratios and qualitative factors to predict bankruptcy.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: The datasets were preprocessed and converted into pandas DataFrames for analysis.
- **Model Implementation**: Both analytical and numerical solutions for Linear Regression were implemented, along with a Logistic Regression model.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Utilized k-fold cross-validation and bootstrap validation to assess model accuracy and robustness.
- **Optimization**: Explored the effects of learning rates and mini-batch sizes on the convergence speed of the models using stochastic gradient descent.

## Results
- The performance of the models was compared, revealing that the Linear Regression model outperformed the Gaussian basis model.
- Insights into feature importance were derived from the trained models, highlighting potential ethical concerns regarding model predictions.

## Future Work
Further exploration with larger and more diverse datasets is recommended, along with the implementation of non-linear models to enhance prediction accuracy.
