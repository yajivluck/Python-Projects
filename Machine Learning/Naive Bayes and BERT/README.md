# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews

This project focuses on implementing and comparing two approaches for sentiment analysis: Naive Bayes from scratch and BERT with pre-trained weights and fine-tuning. The primary goal is to gain experience in implementing a machine learning algorithm from scratch and working with modern deep learning libraries. We will compare the performance of these two methods on the IMDB review dataset.

## Project Goals

1. **Implement Naive Bayes from Scratch:**
   - Develop a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis using fundamental principles.

2. **Implement BERT with Pre-trained Weights and Fine-Tuning:**
   - Utilize a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis.
   - Fine-tune BERT on the IMDB review dataset to optimize performance.

3. **Performance Comparison:**
   - Compare the performance of the Naive Bayes and BERT models on the IMDB review dataset.

## Dataset

- **IMDB Review Dataset:**
  - A popular dataset for sentiment analysis containing movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. This project requires the following:
     - `numpy`
     - `pandas`
     - `sklearn` (for Naive Bayes implementation)
     - `torch`
     - `transformers` (for BERT)

   Install the required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn torch transformers
   ```
